      <ExperienceBio>
        My professional experience story is quite unique. During my studies, I
        discovered that my passion lies in pastry making. I pursued this
        interest independently while working as a pastry chef and eventually
        became the head of the pastry section in a well-known restaurant in
        Wroclaw. Over more than 10 years in the industry, I developed qualities
        such as hard work, patience, organization, responsibility, flexibility,
        and the ability to perform under time pressure. I also learned how to
        seek knowledge and grow independently. At the same time, I never gave up
        on my interest in technology. I transitioned into IT, completing
        postgraduate studies in Frontend Development with Angular, and
        participating in group projects through Dare IT and Tech to the Rescue.
        <Important>
          Today, I am working as a Junior Software Developer at EY, where I
          continue to develop my skills in modern technologies and agile
          teamwork.
        </Important>
        I strongly believe that the discipline, adaptability, and
        problem-solving mindset gained from my earlier career directly support
        my effectiveness in programming projects.
